For this project, I decided to use the calculations from my final chemistry project and plot the results to see a trendline. In the graph, I am plotting the relationship between the maximum electrostatic potential and the pKa (acidity) values of a molecule. Despite a few outliers, the results of the graph did show a general trend that I was able to clearly see.
